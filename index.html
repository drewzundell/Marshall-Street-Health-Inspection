    <p>
      Seven restaurants on Marshall Street have failed their most recent health inspection, according to the <a href=https://www.health.ny.gov> New York State Department of Health.</a> The inspections were conducted between March and August of 2025.
    </p>

    <p>
    Some of the violations include tobacco being used, cross-contamination,  a lack of refrigerator storage, and missing thermometers. Poke Fish, Frozen D Lite, Royal Indian Grill, and Taste of Asia were the businesses on Marshall Street that were noted for critical violations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cross-contamination is defined as the transfer of harmful bacteria, viruses, or allergens, from one surface of food to another, according to the <a href= "https://ask.usda.gov/s/article/What-is-Cross-Contamination#:~:text=Cross%2Dcontamination%20is%20the%20transfer%20of%20harmful%20bacteria,cooked%20or%20ready%2Dto%2Deat%20foods%20and%20fresh%20product.">USDA.</a> This can happen when juices from uncooked foods come in contact with foods that are properly cooked. The juices from these foods, mixed with other foods, contain the bacteria which could cause illness.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cross-contaminated food can lead to foodborne illness, due to the harmful bacteria that is present, according to the <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/food-safety-basics/food-thermometers">USDA.</a> Foodborne illness is contracted when a person consumes this bacteria.
  </p>

  <p>
    The USDA says that "it’s estimated that foodborne illness results in roughly 48 million people getting sick,128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths within the U.S."
  </p>


  <p>
    A <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media_file/2022-05/Consumer_Research_Grilling%20Final_Report_1_23_22.pdf">USDA study</a> found that only 32% of people clean and sanitize the surface used to prepare raw meat.
  </p>

  <p>
    The inspections done on Marshall Street are conducted by the Onondaga County Health Department. These inspections are not just limited to restaurants, but expand to grocery stores, warehouses, and bottling plants.

<p>Royal Indian Grill was reported as having six critical violations, the most out of all the restaurants on Marshall Street. Some of the violations included cross-contamination, lack of thermometers to properly assess food temperature, and toxic chemicals being stored improperly.</p>

<p>
  Poke Fish recorded three violations. One of the three violations, being a critical violation. The critical violation that Poke Fish received was cross contamination of cooked or prepared foods from raw foods.
</p>

<p>
The restaurants on Marshall Street typically receive one or more inspections per year. These can include, but are not limited to, routine check-ins, follow-up visits, and even unannounced visits. Following each inspection, the results are made publicly available.
</p>

<p>
  A critical violation is a violation of the Sanitary Code that could lead to foodborne illness or injury. Critical violations must be corrected in a short window, which are mandated by the New York State Department of Health. If the businesses fail to do so, the consequences can be fines, more frequent inspections, or even temporary closure.
</p>

<p>
  For the seven businesses noted for the violations that occurred on Marshall Street, the reports include what further action is needed, if any.
</p>

<p>
  New York State operates on a letter-grade system, with A being the best, and C being the worst.
</p>

<p>
  Violations are given point deductions. Each violation has a varying point deduction that depends on severity, and the inspector's discretion. For example, failing to keep food at the right minimum temperature, is a minimum of a seven-point deduction. Not properly sanitizing cooking utensils, is a two point minimum violation.
</p>

<p>
  The impact of these inspections can range to minor repercussions to major action taken. Fines, permit suspension, mandatory retraining, and temporary shutdowns are all ramifications a business can face after failing an inspection, according to the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/new-york/title-10/chapter-I/part-14/subpart-14-1/enforcement">New York State Sanitary Code.</a>
</p>
  <p>According to the <a href="https://www.nycfoodpolicy.org/restaurant-grading-system-hunter-college-nyc-food-policy-center/">Hunter College New York City Food Policy Center</a>, if an A-grade is issued to a restaurant, this means that they have received 13 or less points of violation. A B-grade is given to restaurants that have been given from 14-27 points of violation. A C-grade is issued to businesses with over 28 points worth of violation.
</p>

<p>
  Inspections are also contingent on the grade that the restaurant receives. C restaurants are inspected every three to four months, while A restaurants are inspected every 10-12 months.  
</p>

<p>
Aaron Scott is the kitchen manager at Alto Cinco, a restaurant located nearby campus, on Wescott. Scott says that a critical violation is bad for multiple reasons. Customer safety, being the first, but receiving a critical violation also damages reputation.

  "There's a couple of restaurants that are consistently on <a href="https://www.syracuse.com">Syracuse.com</a> for writeups. I know personally, I stay away from these restaurants," Scott said.
</p>

<p>
  Cross contamination is one of the biggest concerns while keeping a kitchen tidy, and keeping customers safe. Scott says that in order to prevent this from happening, the kitchen has to be very particular.
</p>

<p>
  "It could be as simple as somebody dragging a spoon of something over food it's not supposed to go over, and affecting the whole batch. There's so many ways. It's really just about knowing what allergies you have to be aware of for your menu."
</p>

<p>
  Scott says that health inspections can occur at any time. 
</p>

  <p>
    "They'll just show right up. I'll walk upstairs and they're in my coolers. They don't really have to ask."
</p>

<p>
  While Scott says that critical violations are bad for customer safety, and a restaurant's reputation, noncritical violations can be nitpicky things. Scott says that they can even be as small as having a door open to outside. Small, noncritical violations such as these, are fixed immediately.

<p>
  Scott says that his position as kitchen manager is to ensure that violations don't happen. He says that things must be kept very particular in order to keep customers safe, and avoid violations. In Alto Cinco, they even have two different fryers. One for gluten-free food, and the other for food with gluten.
</p>

<p>
  Scott says that having high employee turnover can sometimes lead to violations. He says that he can tell the crew that he has what to do to avoid violations, but if a new person comes, it can become a game of telephone, and "things can get switched up."
</p>

<p>
  Scott says it's important to be vigilant with all of the things around the kitchen, down to even the organization of the fridge. Scott says there are particular ways to arrange and handle food in order to not spread foodborne illness, and to ensure that the fridges and freezers have enough space. Too little space can cause less efficient cooling, and can put the food that it is storing at risk of going bad.
</p>

<p>
"My job as a good manager is to look for those things (safety concerns) while I'm walking around."  
</p>

<p>
  Despite not working on Marshall Street, the expectations that are held for Scott, apply to all New York State businesses. 
</p>
    <p>
      All of the facilities that are on Marshall Street are required to follow state and county food-safety guidelines and regulations. Some of these guidelines include requirements to maintain temperatures in cooling and heating storage units. Along with correct temperatures, businesses must maintain equipment and surfaces. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The New York State Department of Health says the purpose of these inspections is to <a href="https://regs.health.ny.gov/content/section-14-11-purpose">protect the public health</a>. These standards and guidelines look to ensure that offenses aren't happening, and if they are that these offenses are taken care of immediately. 
    </p>

      <p>
        Health hazard violations are to be handled immediately, while offenses other than imminent health hazards look to "be corrected in accordance with a schedule approved by the permit-issuing official," according to the <a href="https://regs.health.ny.gov/content/section-14-11-purpose">New York State Department of Health.</a>
